This is basicaly a web app which is one of the most easiest projects and is done by all newbies when they start learning either js or react or angular etc... My app takes in input from two buttons and run the function when clicked on it.
Also Do Note that the styles are given by the mentor of iNeuron and was given to me as a challenge to not alter HTML nor CSS
